# DNambi's Notes - Simple_Jupyter_Dockers

### Overview

* Goal: Simply embedding multiple docker containers in a Jupyter Notebook
* Idea is to have working prototype by Wednesday at 5pm.
* [Daily Schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eAzEUwbjcgB-4Di4b4hT_w2c9kr9g3_W10VdVF6aiTE/edit)
* [Manuscript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GI9TXTy8mh4kdTKMrYkxzbPwn05Yn4atgC6CVyby7vE/edit?usp=sharing)


**Monday - February 4 Schedule**

```

12:30 - 1:00 -- folks head out to get lunch
All teams return to HQ
1:00 - 1:30: Working lunch -- teams present flowchart of project plan
1:30 - 6:00: Pipeline building <script building>
7:30 - 8:30: Implement any remaining code/start pipelines (remote is an option) <script building>
```


### People + Expertise

* Teammates: Hung (UW Tacoma. Professor?, lhhunghimself@gmail.com), Sinj (sp?) - CS Master's student UW Tacoma (some language barrier), Vera (prod mgr at Nanostring), Dev, Aakash (UW grad student) - genomics work

* Aakash - dry lab computational. expertise is biochem. Good at Python, Jupyter, docker occasionally, quite a bit of cloud expertise, some JS experience
* Sinj - Master's CS student. Not much Docker or Jupyter experience. Used Python a lot. Some JS experience, not super proficient
* Dev - data science and engineering. Good with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Bash, Python. No JS experience. 
* Vera - jill of all trades. C++, R, Python. A little Docker experience, but not extensive. Written docker containers
* Hung - PhD is biochem. C, C++, Python, Perl, Bash experience. Written pipelines.



# Infrastructure

**Key**

'dockerjupyter' user in public key

*Instructions to SSH:*

1. Download the id_rsa.txt file to a working directory
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory
3. Run these commands:

```
chmod 400 id_rsa.txt
ssh -i id_rsa.txt -v ubuntu@54.185.156.17
# Use 'ncbi-hackathon' as the key phrase
```

**Set up the Machine**

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/
All machines have 16 cores. 

```
sudo -i
apt-get update

apt install build-essential

apt-get -y install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

apt-get -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

systemctl start docker
```


### Goals

**Ease of Use**

* Easy input and output parameters
* Use Dockerfiles? Where are they?
* How to define requirements? Containers to run? 

**AIM**

* Goal, stretch goal, fallback goal
* Have a flowchart of what you're trying to build.

* Writer: person responsible for coordinating all the documentation for GitHub readme.
* 10% of teams finish a manuscript
* There's a template manuscript for each team. You just need to barf out 1K words
* Most manuscripts go to f1000 research, hybrid preprint. 2+ positive reviews and you get published in PubMed


**Original**

Have a dockerized GATK pipeline available in a Jupyter notebook. Perhaps https://gencore.bio.nyu.edu/variant-calling-pipeline/


GATK or GATK-Spark? 


**Stretch**

HiC - chromatine? confirmation capture. Aligners. 
https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro

**Fallback**

Have the dockerized GATK pipeline available in Jupyter notebook but without the final analysis bit integrated in.

### AWS / Scaling

* Kubernetes and AWS for Spark?

# NBDocker

* Currently running at https://biodepot.tacoma.uw.edu/hub/login



## Installing NBDocker

*Based on instructions from https://github.com/BioDepot/nbdocker*

* Make sure Docker is running

From a command line:
```
docker pull biodepot/nbdocker

docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /Users/dnambi/Documents/nchackathon:/home/dnambi/work --privileged --group-add root biodepot/nbdocker
```

* What on earth is the permissions model to let this thing run?!
