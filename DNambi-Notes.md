# DNambi's Notes - Simple_Jupyter_Dockers

**Overview**

* Goal: Simply embedding multiple docker containers in a Jupyter Notebook
* Idea is to have working prototype by Wednesday at 5pm.
* Teammates: Hung (UW Tacoma. Professor?, lhhunghimself@gmail.com), Sinj (sp?) - CS Master's student UW Tacoma (some language barrier), Vera (prod mgr at Nanostring), Dev, Aakash (UW grad student) - genomics work
* [Daily Schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eAzEUwbjcgB-4Di4b4hT_w2c9kr9g3_W10VdVF6aiTE/edit)

* h20.ai
   * https://www.h2o.ai/blog/h2o-kubeflow-kubernetes-how-to/


**Expertise**

* Aakash - dry lab computational. expertise is biochem. Good at Python, Jupyter, docker occasionally, quite a bit of cloud expertise, some JS experience
* Sinj - Master's CS student. Not much Docker or Jupyter experience. Used Python a lot. Some JS experience, not super proficient
* Dev - data science and engineering. Good with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Bash, Python. No JS experience. 
* Vera - jill of all trades. C++, R, Python. A little Docker experience, but not extensive. Written docker containers
* Hung - PhD is biochem. C, C++, Python, Perl, Bash experience. Written pipelines.





**Key**

ncbi-hackathon

'dockerjupyter' user in public key


Instructions to SSH in:

1. Download the id_rsa.txt file to a working directory
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory
3. Run these commands:

```
chmod 400 id_rsa.txt
ssh -i id_rsa.txt ubuntu@54.185.156.17
# Use 'ncbi-hackathon' as the key phrase
```

```
chmod 400 id_rsa.txt
ssh -i id_rsa.txt -v ubuntu@54.185.156.17
```

**Set up the Machine**

https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

```
sudo -i
apt-get update

apt install build-essential

apt-get -y install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"

apt-get -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

systemctl start docker
```



**AIM**

* Goal, stretch goal, fallback goal
* Have a flowchart of what you're trying to build.

* Writer: person responsible for coordinating all the documentation for GitHub readme.
* 10% of teams finish a manuscript
* There's a template manuscript for each team. You just need to barf out 1K words
* Most manuscripts go to f1000 research, hybrid preprint. 2+ positive reviews and you get published in PubMed


### Goals

**Original**

Have a dockerized GATK pipeline available in a Jupyter notebook. Perhaps https://gencore.bio.nyu.edu/variant-calling-pipeline/


GATK or GATK-Spark? 


**Stretch**

HiC - chromatine? confirmation capture. Aligners. 
https://github.com/nservant/HiC-Pro

**Fallback**

Have the dockerized GATK pipeline available in Jupyter notebook but without the final analysis bit integrated in.

**Monday - February 4 Schedule**

```
10:00-10:30: Introductions, Administrative Announcements and Building Functional Software
Discussion of Roles
Lead
Understands the science and assigns roles
Consider using something like waffle.io for project management
Sysadmin
Decides where data and tools go, and implements git for versioning.
Deals (in conjunction with technical assistance) with any technical issues (team tech lead)
Writer
Details both product and process for:
Documentation 
Manuscript
Discussion of Output
GitHub
Live cloning of repos
Docker/Singularity
Publishing
Journal Strategy Selection
Advertising and social media
RRID registration
10:30 - 10:45: Technical considerations
Split into teams
10:45 - 11:00: Role assignments in teams
11:00 - 12:30: Sysadmins and Data Acquisition get data, if necessary
Everyone else work on first sketch of plan (one page google doc)
12:30 - 1:00 -- folks head out to get lunch
All teams return to HQ
1:00 - 1:30: Working lunch -- teams present flowchart of project plan
1:30 - 6:00: Pipeline building <script building>
6:30 - 8:30: DINNER (on your own or with group members)
7:30 - 8:30: Implement any remaining code/start pipelines (remote is an option) <script building>
```

# NBDocker

* Currently running at https://biodepot.tacoma.uw.edu/hub/login



## Installing NBDocker

*Based on instructions from https://github.com/BioDepot/nbdocker*

* Make sure Docker is running

From a command line:
```
docker pull biodepot/nbdocker

docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v /Users/dnambi/Documents/nchackathon:/home/dnambi/work --privileged --group-add root biodepot/nbdocker
```

* What on earth is the permissions model to let this thing run?!
