# Simple_Jupyter_Dockers

Simple embedding multiple docker containers in a Jupyter Notebook. 
This hackathon project will leverage nbdocker to integrate create modular end to end workflows informatic pipelines. 
As a proof of concept we will be containerizing a variant calling pipepline and as a stretch goal the Hi-C pipelines.

ToDo: Find ways to integrate aggregating an output file with all the parameters used in the end to end workflow.
